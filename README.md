# Little Logistics: Fabric Edition

### Download

There are no official downloads at this point. From time to time you may find
builds floating arround on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/CBNuD2zfWk) or on the
releases page of this repository.

### Features

Unlike the [Forge version](https://github.com/MuradAkh/LittleLogistics) this version
is missing a lot of features. Kind-of implemented as of now are:

- Steam Tug
- Chest Barge
- Tug Route (as seen on initial release)
- Chains

### Bugs & Contributions

Contributions are welcome. If you want to fix a bug, feel free to open a PR. If you
found one, but can't fix it yourself, file an issue.
If you have a feature suggestion please head over to the [Forge version repo](https://github.com/MuradAkh/LittleLogistics)
and file an issue, as this repo only reimplements their existing features.
